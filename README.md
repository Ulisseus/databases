A free site to learn and try different databases.

**Installation**

1. Fork the repository. If you're new to github refer to this [guide](https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum/wiki/Engineering-Workflow).
2. Download the fork into your local machine. 
3. Install required node modules with `npm i`.
4. Create new .env file, it should look like env.example but with valid credentials instead of `***`. Ask for passwords and api keys on our [chat](https://chat.c0d3.com/c0d3/channels/).
5. Start server with `npm run start:dev` and register a new user.
